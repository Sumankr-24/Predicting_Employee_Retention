# Predicting_Employee_Retention

**Objective**

The objective of this assignment is to develop a Logistic Regression model. You will be using this model to analyse and predict binary outcomes based on the input data. This assignment aims to enhance understanding of logistic regression, including its assumptions, implementation, and evaluation, to effectively classify and interpret data.

**Business Objective**

A mid-sized technology company wants to improve its understanding of employee retention to foster a loyal and committed workforce. While the organization has traditionally focused on addressing turnover, it recognises the value of proactively identifying employees likely to stay and understanding the factors contributing to their loyalty.

In this assignment youâ€™ll be building a logistic regression model to predict the likelihood of employee retention based on the data such as demographic details, job satisfaction scores, performance metrics, and tenure. The aim is to provide the HR department with actionable insights to strengthen retention strategies, create a supportive work environment, and increase the overall stability and satisfaction of the workforce.
